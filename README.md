# Credit Card Offers Application

This is a simple TypeScript application that allows users to have up to 4 different credit cards, each with its own hotel and gas offers. The offers vary based on the type of credit card.

## Overview

The application uses the Visitor pattern to handle the different credit card offers. This allows us to easily add new types of credit cards and offers without needing to modify the existing code.

## Usage

To use the application, simply select the type of credit card you have and view the available hotel and gas offers. You can switch between different credit cards to compare the offers and choose the best one for you.

## Technologies

This application is built using TypeScript and the Visitor design pattern.
